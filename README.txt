Ex1: Difficulties included getting a php server up and running and managing writing php with my current text editor. Also had to set the right time zone for the date part, which was wrong at first. Apart from that this exercise was very straighforward.
Ex2: Straightforward exercise, no particular difficulties to note. 
Ex3: Small difficulties in testing where I had to write a part of code to delete the cookies when I wanted to test, apart from that it was straightforward.
Ex4: Sessions caused some problems, when they had to be opened on each page. The button and form submission with javascript and php side by side also caused problems, but in the end it worked out well. 
IMPORTANT: Start page is home.php
